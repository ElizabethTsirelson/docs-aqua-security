## <a id="image-scanning"></a> Deploying Aqua Enforcers

This section describes the deployment of an Aqua Enforcer with BOSH on all Diego cells in your CF cluster nodes by using a deployment add-on, which automatically deploys a single Aqua Enforcer container on each Diego cell in your cluster.

First, you create a new Enforcer group in the Aqua Server. An Enforcer group is a set of Aqua Enforcers with the same configuration. You need to create one that will work with Pivotal Application Service (PAS); you cannot use the default Enforcer group for this.

A byproduct of the Enforcer group creation is the add-on required for BOSH. Aqua does not automatically deploy the Enforcer on Diego cells; you do this by using BOSH commands.

All Enforcers deployed with the following commands will have the same configuration. If you need Enforcers with different characteristics, you will need to create one or more additional Enforcer groups.
